#+title: Papier: a simple recursive document language

* Info
Papier is a language where you only have text and sub-documents. Sub-documents
have titles, tags, and may be in an external format.

** Inspiration
- Emacs' ~org-mode~
  - Tree
    - Tree-based operations
  - Tags
    - Search
  - Extensibility
    - Agenda, TODOs
    - Code blocks & evaluation
    - Drawers
      - Metadata
    - Tables

- JSON' simplicity
  - It's hard to take things away from JSON
  - Powerful because of recursion
  - Fast because it's a small language
  - Simple to learn because it's a small language
  - Although IMO it's too lax on indentation (and types too, but that's a data language).

- Markdown's readability
  - Simple formatting, meant to be readable in raw text.

- "smart" tabs
  - Tabs indent semantically, spaces align
    - Line width might be a problem, but we have line wrapping and stupidly wide screens nowadays.
    - Randomly breaking lines because of a width issue breaks semantics.
      - It's easier to author a document where lines are sentences/ideas rather
        than random parts of a paragraph.
